## Front End Developer

# Summary

I am a proactive and creative front end developer. I am currently working at MercadoLibre at Buenos Aires, Argentina.

I enjoy taking advantage of awesome new browser features without breaking the experience on older browser. I am up to date with IT trends and innovation. I really love to experiment with new web technologies, APIs and standards.

I write semantic HTML and CSS code that works perfectly on all modern browsers. I love JavaScript and I know its good parts. I keep a close eye on JavaScript development client and server side, user interfaces, interaction design, web technologies and web standards.

I've been developing clean, valid and compatible websites, libraries and UI widgets since the last 5 years. I am skilled to define and maintain well crafted, complex and large libraries.
